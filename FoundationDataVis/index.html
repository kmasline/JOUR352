      <p>Of the Illinois complaints, 74 were regarding federal student loans. Fifty-three Illinois complaints were about private loans. Just under a third of the complaints came from zip codes in the city of Chicago. Residents of zip code 60657, which includes the cityâ€™s Lake View neighborhood, submitted the most claims. These complaints made up 19% of Chicago complaints and 6% of state complaints. Of the 22 unique Chicago zip codes where complaints were made, eight saw at least two complaints. Outside of the city, the only zip code where more than two complaints were made was 60074, which belongs to the Chicago suburb of Palatine.</p>
