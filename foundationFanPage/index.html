<h1>Justin Jefferson Fan Page</h1>
</div>




<div class="large-6 medium-12 small-12 cell">
<p>Justin Jefferson is a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings. He was drafted 22nd overall in the 2020 NFL Draft. He played college football at LSU, where his team won the National Championship during his junior season. He broke the NFL record for most receiving yards by a Super Bowl era rookie in the 2020-2021 season, but his former LSU teammate, Bengals WR Ja'Marr Chase, broke the record the following year.
</p>
<br>
<p>After two seasons, Jefferson has been the best receiver from his draft class. He received All-Pro Team votes in both his rookie and sophomore seasons and made the Pro Bowl both years. Jefferson broke Odell Beckham Jr.'s record for the most receiving yards in a player's first two NFL seasons.

</br>

</p>
<br>

<p>Jefferson was selected with the first round pick the Vikings acquired from the Buffalo Bills in the Stefon Diggs trade.
Jefferson is also well known for popularizing a dance called the Griddy. Jefferson did the dance while playing in college and continued doing it once he made it to the pros. Many other NFL players followed Jefferson's lead in doing the dance as a touchdown celebration.
