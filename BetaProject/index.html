<p>From Stefon Diggs and D.J. Moore to Jake Funk and Darnell Savage Jr., it’s not unusual to hear a former Maryland Terrapins' name called during the annual NFL Draft. Two former University of Maryland football players joined the ranks of the NFL in the 2022 Draft, which took place from April 28 to April 30. Safety Nick Cross was selected as a third round pick by the Indianapolis Colts and tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the fourth round.</p>

<p>Since 2015, the first NFL Draft after Maryland joined the Big Ten Conference, 16 Terps have been drafted, including two first round picks, according to <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/schools/maryland/drafted.htm" target="_blank">Pro Football Reference.</a> In that period, Maryland is tied with Nebraska for the eighth most draft picks in the Big Ten. According to the <a href="https://umterps.com/news/2021/9/9/terps-in-the-nfl-regular-season-primer.aspx" target="_blank">University of Maryland Athletics Department</a>, 12 Terps made opening day rosters in 2021.</p>

<div class="large-6 medium-12 small-12">
  <p>The pre-draft process this year began with the East West Shrine Bowl, an event that started in 1925 to benefit Shriners Hospitals for Children, according to the <a href="https://shrinebowl.com/about-us/" target="_blank">event’s website</a>. The 2022 Shrine Bowl took place on Feb. 3, in which <a href="https://shrinebowl.com/west-roster/" target="_blank">Okonkwo</a> played for the West team.</p>

  <p>During the annual NFL Combine, which took place during the first week of March, Okonkwo and Cross ran the fastest 40-yard dash times for their respective positions, according to <a href="https://www.nfl.com/combine/tracker/live-results/40-yards-dash/all-positions/all-colleges/" target="_blank">NFL.com</a>. Cross ran a 4.34 40-yard dash, which was tied with Rutgers wide receiver Bo Melton for the eighth fastest time among all participants. Ahead of Cross were four wide receivers and three cornerbacks.</p>

  <p>Cross is the latest Maryland safety to hear his name called during the annual event. In 2019, <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SavaDa00.htm" target="_blank"> Darnell Savage Jr.</a> was selected with the 21st pick in the first round by the Green Bay Packers. The following year, the Pittsburgh Steelers selected <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrooAn00.htm" target="_blank">Antoine Brooks Jr.</a> in the sixth round. Brooks was signed by the Los Angeles Rams in November 2021 after the <a href="https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-reduce-roster-to-80" target="_blank">Steelers</a> waived him earlier that season.</p>

  <p>Okonkwo is the first Maryland tight end to be drafted since the team joined the Big Ten. The most recent Maryland tight end to be selected was <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GronDa00.htm" target="_blank">Dan Gronkowski</a>, who was a seventh-round pick by the Detroit Lions in 2009. The oldest of four brothers, all of whom played in the NFL, Gronkowski played in 21 games over 3 seasons.</p>

  <p>The most notable tight end to come out of College Park is <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DaviVe00.htm" target="_blank">Vernon Davis</a>, who was selected with the sixth overall pick by the San Francisco 49ers in 2006. Davis played in 198 games, made two Pro Bowl appearances and won Super Bowl L with the Denver Broncos before retiring after the 2019-2020 season.</p>

  <p>Maryland has had a knack for producing successful players at offensive skill positions, particularly wide receivers and running backs. The first Terp to be selected in the school’s Big Ten era was wide receiver <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DiggSt00.htm" target="_blank">Stefon Diggs</a>, a fifth-round pick by the Minnesota Vikings. Diggs has gone on to have four consecutive seasons with over 1,000 yards from 2018 to 2021, leading the league in receiving yards in 2020. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorD.00.htm" target="_blank">D.J. Moore</a>, a first-round pick by the Carolina Panthers in 2018, has had three consecutive seasons with more than 1,000 receiving yards during his four years as a pro. Moore is entering the last year of his rookie contract and signed an extension with the Panthers in March, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33538536/carolina-panthers-dj-moore-agree-new-four-year-contract" target="_blank">ESPN</a>.</p>

  <p>The only Maryland player who was drafted in 2021 was running back Jake Funk, a seventh-round pick by the Super Bowl LVI champion Los Angeles Rams. Funk suited up for 10 games as a rookie, playing 3% of offensive snaps and 48% of special teams snaps during those games, according to stats from <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FunkJa00.htm#snap_counts" target="_blank">Pro Football Reference</a>.</p>

  <p>Running back Ty Johnson, a sixth-round pick by the Detroit Lions in 2019, had <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnTy02.htm#rushing_and_receiving" target="_blank">610 total yards from scrimmage</a> in his first full season as a New York Jet. Johnson led all three active former Maryland running backs in this category. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McFaAn00.htm" target="_blank">Anthony McFarland Jr.</a>, a fourth-round pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2020, played his second season with the team in 2021.</p>

  <p>Cross and Okonkwo are just starting their journeys as professional football players. But the history of Terrapins in the draft shows a wide range of possibilities. The trend likely won’t be stopping any time soon. In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAkBX50HsdI&t=329s" target="_blank">Bootleg Football Podcast</a>, Okonkwo shared his thoughts on the program’s future in the draft.</p>

  <p>“There’s going to be a lot of players going to the NFL out of Maryland over the next few years,” Okonkwo said.</p>
